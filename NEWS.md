- when using _Pandora_ skin, in _Import Data_:
  - option to prepare data before import or merge
    - rename columns
    - join columns
    - split columns
    - delete columns
  - option to merge two data tables before import (#37)

### Updates

- _export of plots_ after modelling: hide option to create a time series for
_Time Course_ plot type (#8)

### Bug Fixes

- fix naming issue when data contains columns exactly named "latitude" or "longitude"

- switch the title for min/max range dependent on the "Plot type"

### Bug fixes

- fix update of min/max values after removing a restriction (min/max values had been overwritten
before, that is, removing a restriction did not reset min/max values) (#27)
- remove duplicated re-rendering of the map when changing "Estimation type" or restricting the range
- update choices of "Estimation type" when switching the "Plot type" in _TimeR_ since some types
are not implemented for "Time course"
- debounce inputs for min/max range to prevent re-rendering of the map when typing min/max values 

## Version 22.10.3

- new UI to specify the section of maps of modelling tabs (_AverageR, TimeR, SpreadR, KernelR,
KernelTimeR, OperatorR, LocateR_)

  - apply a button "Set (Time and) Map Section" to set
    - time (only for _TimeR_ and _KernelTimeR_),
    - zoom in degrees of longitude, or
    - lat/long of upper left corner
- new modules that encapsulate the functionality behind the new UI
- applying the new modules in all modelling tabs and removing copy-paste code

longitude and latitude of the displayed data

found (#67)
  - note: the default format is "decimal degrees", here we still apply the check for numeric columns

### Bug fixes

- fix failing of import of xlsx files with sheets (-> option to select the sheet)
- fix missing columns in the selection of `Longitude` and `Latitude` if `Coordinate format` was not
equal "decimal degrees" (#62)
- fix in the removal of points on the interactive map after using filters (#63)
